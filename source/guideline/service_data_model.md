# Service Data Model {#sec:service_data_model}

This section describes the logical data structures to be exchanged between providers and consumers of the service. The service data model is bound by the current definition of the IHO S-125. For complete and updated documentation refer to the latest S-125 Product Specification which can be found at:
    
    https://iho.int/en/nipwg-product-specifications.

Included in the service data model is a full description followed by specific extracts for;

* AtoN Information Features and Information types
* Enumerations
* Complex Attributes

Note that the S-100 specification [@cite:iho-s100] describes in Appendix 9-B how S-100 based data models shall be formulated in XML schema format.

Since the main purpose of the discussed service is to provide AtoN information to ECDIS, the S-125 information should be packaged as S-100 datasets, alongside any necessary metadata and other support information. The S-100 data model specification [@cite:iho-s100] in Appendix 4aS-100 Part 17, introduces the Exchange Set data structure, precisely for supporting this functionality. To indicate that S-125 datasets are coupled with additional service metadata, we refer to the type S100ExchangeSet (see [@fig:s125_with_metadata]).

# Service Internal Data Model

As the S-125 data model, used to represent the transmitted data, is developed independently from this service specification, the internal data model of the service should be adequate to generate the required S-125 datasets. In addition, a way to store service metadata that are not directly related to the data model (internal service identifies, signatures, etc.) is required. For further information, refer to IALA Guideline 1157. However, these metadata are mostly implementation specific and therefore are not discussed in this service specification. Examples on how to implement this functionality can also be found in the IMO’s S-100 data model specification [@cite:iho-s100], as well as the SECOM standard [@cite:iec-63173-2].
